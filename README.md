This repository is the rewrite and modularization of "flightcode_v2.cpp" by Sunip Mukherjee. All questions about this repository should be directed to Samuel Gregory at samuel_gregory@student.uml.edu.

This project is tentatively expected to be completed before the end of October 2020

Note: Flightcam follows the design laid out for the shflight repository. Flightcam does not use any sycnhroizers, and mentions to them in the design guide are treated as superflous, as no threads wait on each other. All threads are independent.
